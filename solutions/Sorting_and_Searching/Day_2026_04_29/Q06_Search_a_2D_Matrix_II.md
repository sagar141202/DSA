# Search a 2D Matrix II

## Problem Statement
Write a function that searches for a target value in a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in ascending order and each column is sorted in ascending order. The function should return true if the target is found and false otherwise. The matrix can contain duplicate values and can be empty. For example, given the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
And the target value is 5, the function should return true because 5 is present in the matrix.

## Approach
The algorithm starts from the top-right corner of the matrix and compares the target value with the current element. If the target is less than the current element, it moves left; otherwise, it moves down. This approach ensures that the search space is reduced at each step.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m + n)
- Space: O(1)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int rows = matrix.size();
        int cols = matrix[0].size();
        
        int row = 0;
        int col = cols - 1;
        
        while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                row++;
            } else {
                col--;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: matrix = [
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
], target = 5
Output: true

Input: matrix = [
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
], target = 20
Output: false
```

## Key Takeaways
- Start from the top-right corner of the matrix to reduce the search space.
- Move left if the target is less than the current element; otherwise, move down.
- The time complexity is O(m + n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
