# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(min(m,n))). The median of a single array is the middle element when the array is sorted in ascending order. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. For example, given `nums1 = [1, 3]` and `nums2 = [2]`, the median is `2`. Given `nums1 = [1, 2]` and `nums2 = [3, 4]`, the median is `(2 + 3)/2 = 2.5`.

## Approach
We will use a binary search approach to find the median of the two sorted arrays. The idea is to partition both arrays such that the elements on the left side of the partition are less than the elements on the right side. We will then adjust the partition based on the total number of elements on the left side to find the median.

## Complexity
- Time: O(log(min(m,n)))
- Space: O(1)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        // Make sure that nums1 is the smaller array
        if (nums1.size() > nums2.size()) {
            return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);
        }
        
        int x = nums1.size();
        int y = nums2.size();
        
        int low = 0;
        int high = x;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int partitionX = (low + high) / 2;
            int partitionY = (x + y + 1) / 2 - partitionX;
            
            int maxLeftX = (partitionX == 0) ? INT_MIN : nums1[partitionX - 1];
            int minRightX = (partitionX == x) ? INT_MAX : nums1[partitionX];
            
            int maxLeftY = (partitionY == 0) ? INT_MIN : nums2[partitionY - 1];
            int minRightY = (partitionY == y) ? INT_MAX : nums2[partitionY];
            
            if (maxLeftX <= minRightY && maxLeftY <= minRightX) {
                if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
                    return (max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY) + min(minRightX, minRightY)) / 2.0;
                } else {
                    return (double) max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY);
                }
            } else if (maxLeftX > minRightY) {
                high = partitionX - 1;
            } else {
                low = partitionX + 1;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.0
Input: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]
Output: 2.5
```

## Key Takeaways
- The binary search approach is used to find the median of two sorted arrays in O(log(min(m,n))) time complexity.
- The partitioning of the arrays is based on the total number of elements on the left side to find the median.
- The solution handles both even and odd total number of elements to find the median correctly.
