# Sort Colors (Dutch Flag)

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array in a single pass such that all 0s come first, followed by all 1s, and then all 2s. This problem is also known as the Dutch Flag problem. The array should be sorted in-place, meaning no extra space should be used.

## Approach
We will use three pointers: low, mid, and high. The low pointer will track the position of the next 0, the mid pointer will track the position of the next 1, and the high pointer will track the position of the next 2. We will iterate through the array, swapping elements as necessary to maintain the correct order.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
    int low = 0;
    int mid = 0;
    int high = nums.size() - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] == 0) {
            swap(nums[low], nums[mid]);
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        } else {
            swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);
            high--;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0};
    sortColors(nums);
    for (int num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Input: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

## Key Takeaways
- We can solve this problem in a single pass using three pointers.
- The low and mid pointers are used to track the positions of the next 0 and 1, respectively.
- The high pointer is used to track the position of the next 2.
