# Sort Colors (Dutch Flag)

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array in a single pass such that all 0s are first, followed by all 1s, and then all 2s. This problem is also known as the Dutch Flag problem. The array should be sorted in-place, meaning no additional space should be used.

## Approach
We can solve this problem using a three-pointer technique. The idea is to maintain three pointers: low, mid, and high. The low pointer is used to track the position where the next 0 should be placed, the mid pointer is used to scan the array, and the high pointer is used to track the position where the next 2 should be placed.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
    int low = 0; // pointer for 0s
    int mid = 0; // pointer for 1s
    int high = nums.size() - 1; // pointer for 2s

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] == 0) {
            // swap nums[low] and nums[mid]
            swap(nums[low], nums[mid]);
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        } else {
            // swap nums[mid] and nums[high]
            swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);
            high--;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0};
    sortColors(nums);
    for (int num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Input: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use three pointers to track the positions of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the array.
- Iterate through the array only once to achieve a time complexity of O(n).
- Use in-place swapping to achieve a space complexity of O(1).
