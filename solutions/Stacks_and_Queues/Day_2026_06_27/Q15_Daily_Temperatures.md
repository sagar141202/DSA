# Daily Temperatures

## Problem Statement
Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature occurs. If a warmer temperature does not occur, the answer is 0. The temperature values are distinct. For example, given the temperatures [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], the output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

## Approach
We can use a stack to store the indices of the temperatures. We iterate through the temperatures, and for each temperature, we pop all the indices from the stack where the temperature at that index is less than the current temperature, and update the result array accordingly. This way, we ensure that the stack always contains the indices of the temperatures that are greater than the current temperature.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
    int n = temperatures.size();
    vector<int> result(n, 0);
    stack<int> st;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // pop all indices from the stack where the temperature is less than the current temperature
        while (!st.empty() && temperatures[st.top()] < temperatures[i]) {
            int idx = st.top();
            st.pop();
            result[idx] = i - idx;
        }
        st.push(i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a stack to store the indices of the temperatures.
- Iterate through the temperatures and pop all indices from the stack where the temperature is less than the current temperature.
- Update the result array accordingly to store the number of days until a warmer temperature occurs.
