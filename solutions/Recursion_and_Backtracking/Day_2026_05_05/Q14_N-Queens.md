# N-Queens

## Problem Statement
The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in the field of computer science, where the goal is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. A queen can attack another queen if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem statement requires finding all possible configurations of the board where the queens are placed safely. For example, for a 4x4 board, there are two possible configurations.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves using recursion and backtracking to try all possible placements of queens on the board. We start by placing the first queen in the first row, and then recursively try to place the remaining queens in the subsequent rows. If a queen cannot be placed in a row without being attacked, we backtrack and try a different placement.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N!)
- Space: O(N)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        vector<string> board(n, string(n, '.'));
        solve(result, board, 0);
        return result;
    }
    
    void solve(vector<vector<string>>& result, vector<string>& board, int row) {
        if (row == board.size()) {
            result.push_back(board);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int col = 0; col < board.size(); col++) {
            if (isValid(board, row, col)) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                solve(result, board, row + 1);
                board[row][col] = '.';
            }
        }
    }
    
    bool isValid(vector<string>& board, int row, int col) {
        int n = board.size();
        
        // Check column
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Check upper-left diagonal
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Check upper-right diagonal
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0 && j < n; i--, j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 4;
    vector<vector<string>> result = solution.solveNQueens(n);
    for (auto& board : result) {
        for (auto& row : board) {
            cout << row << endl;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 
[
  [".Q..", "...Q", "Q...", "..Q."],
  ["..Q.", "Q...", "...Q", ".Q.."]
]
```

## Key Takeaways
- The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using recursion and backtracking.
- The time complexity of the solution is O(N!), where N is the number of queens.
- The space complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of queens.
