# N-Queens

## Problem Statement
The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in the field of computer science, where the goal is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. A queen can attack another queen if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem requires finding all possible configurations of the board where the queens are placed safely. For example, for a 4x4 board, there are two possible configurations.

## Approach
The solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to place the queens on the board one row at a time, ensuring that each placement is safe. The algorithm checks for safety by verifying that the newly placed queen does not attack any previously placed queens. If a safe placement is found, the algorithm recursively attempts to place the next queen.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N!)
- Space: O(N)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        vector<string> board(n, string(n, '.'));
        solve(result, board, 0);
        return result;
    }
    
    void solve(vector<vector<string>>& result, vector<string>& board, int row) {
        if (row == board.size()) {
            result.push_back(board);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int col = 0; col < board.size(); col++) {
            if (isValid(board, row, col)) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                solve(result, board, row + 1);
                board[row][col] = '.';
            }
        }
    }
    
    bool isValid(vector<string>& board, int row, int col) {
        int n = board.size();
        
        // Check column
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Check upper-left diagonal
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Check upper-right diagonal
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0 && j < n; i--, j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: n = 4
Output: [
  [".Q..", "...Q", "Q...", "..Q."],
  ["..Q.", "Q...", "...Q", ".Q.."]
]
```

## Key Takeaways
- The N-Queens problem can be solved using a recursive backtracking approach.
- The time complexity of the solution is O(N!), where N is the number of queens.
- The space complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of queens.
