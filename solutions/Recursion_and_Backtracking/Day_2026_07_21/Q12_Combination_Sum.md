# Combination Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate number is a sum of the target. The same number may be used an unlimited number of times. The solution should be sorted in ascending order.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using recursion and backtracking. We start by selecting each number in the array and recursively finding combinations that sum up to the remaining target. If the remaining target becomes zero, we have found a valid combination.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N^(T/M + 1)) where N is the number of candidates, T is the target, and M is the minimum value among the candidates
- Space: O(T/M) for the recursion stack

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void backtrack(int remain, vector<int>& comb, int start, vector<int>& candidates, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
    if (remain == 0) {
        result.push_back(comb);
        return;
    } else if (remain < 0) {
        return;
    }
    for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); i++) {
        comb.push_back(candidates[i]);
        backtrack(remain - candidates[i], comb, i, candidates, result);
        comb.pop_back();
    }
}

vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    vector<int> comb;
    backtrack(target, comb, 0, candidates, result);
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> candidates = {2, 3, 5};
    int target = 8;
    vector<vector<int>> result = combinationSum(candidates, target);
    for (auto& vec : result) {
        for (auto& num : vec) {
            cout << num << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: candidates = [2, 3, 5], target = 8
Output: [[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use recursion and backtracking to solve problems that involve finding combinations or permutations.
- The recursion function should have a clear base case to stop the recursion.
- The backtracking step is crucial to explore all possible solutions.
