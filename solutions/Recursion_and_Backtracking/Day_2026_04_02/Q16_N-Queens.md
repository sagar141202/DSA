# N-Queens

## Problem Statement
The N-Queens problem is a classic problem of placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The problem requires finding all possible configurations of the board where N queens are placed safely. The input is an integer N, which represents the size of the chessboard, and the output is a list of all possible configurations.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is to use backtracking, where we try to place a queen in each column of the current row and recursively check if the placement is safe. If the placement is safe, we move to the next row; otherwise, we backtrack and try a different placement.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N!)
- Space: O(N)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        vector<string> board(n, string(n, '.'));
        solve(result, board, 0);
        return result;
    }

    void solve(vector<vector<string>>& result, vector<string>& board, int row) {
        if (row == board.size()) {
            result.push_back(board);
            return;
        }
        for (int col = 0; col < board.size(); col++) {
            if (isValid(board, row, col)) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                solve(result, board, row + 1);
                board[row][col] = '.';
            }
        }
    }

    bool isValid(vector<string>& board, int row, int col) {
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board.size(); j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'Q' && (j == col || abs(j - col) == row - i)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 4
Output: [
  [".Q..", "...Q", "Q...", "..Q."],
  ["..Q.", "Q...", "...Q", ".Q.."]
]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use backtracking to try all possible placements of queens on the board.
- Check if a placement is safe by verifying that no two queens attack each other.
- Use a recursive approach to solve the problem, where each recursive call tries to place a queen in the next row.
