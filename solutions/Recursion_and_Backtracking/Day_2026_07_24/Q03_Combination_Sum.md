# Combination Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`. The same number may be used an unlimited number of times. The solution should be in lexicographic order.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using recursion and backtracking, where we try to add each number in the candidates array to the current combination and recursively call the function with the updated target. We use backtracking to remove the last added number when the target becomes negative or when we have found all combinations.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N^(T/M + 1)) where N is the number of candidates, T is the target, and M is the minimum value in the candidates array
- Space: O(T/M) for the recursion stack

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void backtrack(int remain, vector<int>& comb, int start, vector<int>& candidates, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
    if (remain == 0) {
        result.push_back(comb);
        return;
    } else if (remain < 0) {
        return;
    }
    for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); i++) {
        comb.push_back(candidates[i]);
        backtrack(remain - candidates[i], comb, i, candidates, result);
        comb.pop_back();
    }
}

vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    vector<int> comb;
    backtrack(target, comb, 0, candidates, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use recursion and backtracking to solve problems that involve trying all possible combinations.
- Use a helper function to perform the recursive calls and backtrack when necessary.
- Use a vector to store the current combination and another vector to store the result.
