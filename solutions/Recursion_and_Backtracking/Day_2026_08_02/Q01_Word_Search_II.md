# Word Search II

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where adjacent cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

## Approach
The solution uses a Trie data structure to store the dictionary words and a backtracking approach to find all words in the board. It iterates over each cell in the board and uses the Trie to check if a word can be formed from that cell.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N*M*4^L), where N is the number of rows, M is the number of columns, and L is the maximum length of a word.
- Space: O(N*M + total length of all words), for the Trie and the backtracking stack.

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TrieNode {
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    string word;
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        for (string word : words) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            for (char c : word) {
                if (node->children.find(c) == node->children.end()) {
                    node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node->children[c];
            }
            node->word = word;
        }

        vector<string> result;
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(board.size(), vector<bool>(board[0].size(), false));
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                backtrack(board, root, i, j, visited, result);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    void backtrack(vector<vector<char>>& board, TrieNode* node, int i, int j, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, vector<string>& result) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || visited[i][j] || node->children.find(board[i][j]) == node->children.end()) {
            return;
        }

        visited[i][j] = true;
        node = node->children[board[i][j]];
        if (!node->word.empty()) {
            result.push_back(node->word);
            node->word.clear();
        }

        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
        for (pair<int, int> direction : directions) {
            backtrack(board, node, i + direction.first, j + direction.second, visited, result);
        }

        visited[i][j] = false;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<char>> board = {
        {'o', 'a', 'a', 'n'},
        {'e', 't', 'a', 'e'},
        {'i', 'h', 'k', 'r'},
        {'i', 'f', 'l', 'v'}
    };
    vector<string> words = {"oath", "pea", "eat", "rain"};
    vector<string> result = solution.findWords(board, words);
    for (string word : result) {
        cout << word << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
board = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a Trie data structure to store the dictionary words for efficient lookup.
- Use a backtracking approach to find all words in the board.
- Use a visited matrix to keep track of visited cells and avoid revisiting them.
