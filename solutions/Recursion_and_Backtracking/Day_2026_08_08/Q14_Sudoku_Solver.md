# Sudoku Solver

## Problem Statement
The Sudoku Solver problem is a classic problem in the realm of recursion and backtracking. Given a 9x9 Sudoku grid, some of the cells are filled with numbers from 1 to 9, while others are empty. The goal is to fill in all the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains each number exactly once. The input is a 2D vector of integers, where 0 represents an empty cell. The output is a boolean indicating whether a solution exists, and the modified input grid is the solution if it exists. For example, given the input:
```
5 3 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0
6 0 0 | 1 9 5 | 0 0 0
0 9 8 | 0 0 0 | 0 6 0
-------------------------
8 0 0 | 0 6 0 | 0 0 3
4 0 0 | 8 0 3 | 0 0 1
7 0 0 | 0 2 0 | 0 0 6
-------------------------
0 6 0 | 0 0 0 | 2 8 0
0 0 0 | 4 1 9 | 0 0 5
0 0 0 | 0 8 0 | 0 7 9
```
The output should be a solved Sudoku grid.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is to use recursion and backtracking. We start by filling in the empty cells one by one, and for each cell, we try numbers from 1 to 9. If a number is valid in the current cell, we recursively try to fill in the rest of the grid. If we cannot fill in the rest of the grid, we backtrack and try the next number.

## Complexity
- Time: O(9^(n*n)) where n is the size of the grid, because in the worst case, we have to try all numbers for all cells.
- Space: O(n*n) for the recursive call stack.

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool isValid(vector<vector<int>>& board, int row, int col, int num) {
    // Check the row
    for (int x = 0; x < 9; x++) {
        if (board[row][x] == num) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check the column
    for (int x = 0; x < 9; x++) {
        if (board[x][col] == num) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check the box
    int startRow = row - row % 3;
    int startCol = col - col % 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            if (board[i + startRow][j + startCol] == num) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool solveSudoku(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 0) {
                for (int num = 1; num <= 9; num++) {
                    if (isValid(board, i, j, num)) {
                        board[i][j] = num;
                        if (solveSudoku(board)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        board[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> board = {
        {5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0},
        {0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0},
        {8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3},
        {4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1},
        {7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6},
        {0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5},
        {0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9}
    };

    if (solveSudoku(board)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                cout << board[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    } else {
        cout << "No solution exists" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Takeaways
- The key to solving Sudoku puzzles is to use recursion and backtracking to try all possible numbers in each empty cell.
- The `isValid` function is crucial to ensure that the number we are trying to place in a cell does not already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 box.
- The `solveSudoku` function uses recursion to try all possible numbers in each empty cell, and backtracking to restore the cell to its original state if a solution is not found.
