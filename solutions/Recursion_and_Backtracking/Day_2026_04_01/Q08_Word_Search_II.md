# Word Search II

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word. The words can be found in any order, and all words must be found.

## Approach
We will use a Trie data structure to store the dictionary words, and then use backtracking to explore all possible paths in the board. We will start from each cell in the board and try to find a word by moving in all four directions.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N * M * 4^L), where N and M are the dimensions of the board, and L is the maximum length of a word
- Space: O(N * M + D), where D is the number of nodes in the Trie

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TrieNode {
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    string word;
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        for (string word : words) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            for (char c : word) {
                if (node->children.find(c) == node->children.end()) {
                    node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node->children[c];
            }
            node->word = word;
        }
        
        vector<string> result;
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(board.size(), vector<bool>(board[0].size(), false));
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                dfs(board, i, j, root, result, visited);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, TrieNode* node, vector<string>& result, vector<vector<bool>>& visited) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || visited[i][j] || node->children.find(board[i][j]) == node->children.end()) {
            return;
        }
        
        visited[i][j] = true;
        node = node->children[board[i][j]];
        if (!node->word.empty()) {
            result.push_back(node->word);
            node->word.clear();
        }
        
        dfs(board, i - 1, j, node, result, visited);
        dfs(board, i + 1, j, node, result, visited);
        dfs(board, i, j - 1, node, result, visited);
        dfs(board, i, j + 1, node, result, visited);
        
        visited[i][j] = false;
    }
};

```

## Test Cases
```
Input: board = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a Trie data structure to efficiently store and retrieve words from the dictionary
- Use backtracking to explore all possible paths in the board and find words
- Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting the same cell and to ensure that each word is found only once.
