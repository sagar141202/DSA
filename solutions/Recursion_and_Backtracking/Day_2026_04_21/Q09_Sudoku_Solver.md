# Sudoku Solver

## Problem Statement
The Sudoku Solver problem is a classic problem in the field of computer science and puzzle solving. The goal is to fill in a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains each number exactly once. The input is a 2D array representing the Sudoku grid, where empty cells are denoted by 0. The task is to write a function that takes this grid as input and returns a solved Sudoku grid, or indicates that no solution exists.

## Approach
The approach to solving this problem involves using recursion and backtracking to try different numbers in each empty cell, and checking if the current state of the grid is valid. If the grid is valid, we continue to the next empty cell, and if not, we backtrack and try a different number.

## Complexity
- Time: O(9^(n*n)) where n is the size of the grid, since in the worst case, we have to try all possible numbers for each cell.
- Space: O(n*n) for the recursive call stack and the grid itself.

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool isValid(vector<vector<int>>& board, int row, int col, int num) {
    // Check the row and column
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        if (board[row][i] == num || board[i][col] == num) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check the 3x3 sub-grid
    int startRow = row - row % 3;
    int startCol = col - col % 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            if (board[i + startRow][j + startCol] == num) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool solveSudoku(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 0) {
                for (int num = 1; num <= 9; num++) {
                    if (isValid(board, i, j, num)) {
                        board[i][j] = num;
                        if (solveSudoku(board)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        board[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> board = {
        {5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0},
        {0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0},
        {8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3},
        {4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1},
        {7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6},
        {0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5},
        {0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9}
    };

    if (solveSudoku(board)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                cout << board[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    } else {
        cout << "No solution exists" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1

Output:

6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3

## Key Takeaways
- The Sudoku Solver problem can be solved using recursion and backtracking.
- The `isValid` function checks if it's valid to place a number in a given cell, and the `solveSudoku` function uses this to try different numbers in each empty cell.
- The time complexity of the solution is O(9^(n*n)) due to the recursive nature of the algorithm, and the space complexity is O(n*n) for the grid and the recursive call stack.
