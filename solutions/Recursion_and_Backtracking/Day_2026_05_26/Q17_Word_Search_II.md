# Word Search II

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where adjacent cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

## Approach
The solution involves using a Trie data structure to store the dictionary words and then performing a depth-first search on the board to find all possible words. The Trie allows for efficient lookup and pruning of branches that do not lead to valid words.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N * M * 4^L), where N and M are the dimensions of the board, and L is the maximum length of a word
- Space: O(N * M + W), where W is the total number of characters in the dictionary

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    string word;
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        for (string word : words) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            for (char c : word) {
                if (node->children.find(c) == node->children.end()) {
                    node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node->children[c];
            }
            node->word = word;
        }

        vector<string> result;
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(board.size(), vector<bool>(board[0].size(), false));
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                dfs(board, i, j, root, result, visited);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, TrieNode* node, vector<string>& result, vector<vector<bool>>& visited) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || visited[i][j] || node->children.find(board[i][j]) == node->children.end()) {
            return;
        }

        visited[i][j] = true;
        node = node->children[board[i][j]];
        if (!node->word.empty()) {
            result.push_back(node->word);
            node->word.clear();
        }

        dfs(board, i - 1, j, node, result, visited);
        dfs(board, i + 1, j, node, result, visited);
        dfs(board, i, j - 1, node, result, visited);
        dfs(board, i, j + 1, node, result, visited);

        visited[i][j] = false;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: board = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Using a Trie data structure can significantly improve the efficiency of the solution
- Depth-first search is a suitable approach for exploring the board and finding all possible words
- Proper handling of visited cells is crucial to avoid counting the same word multiple times
