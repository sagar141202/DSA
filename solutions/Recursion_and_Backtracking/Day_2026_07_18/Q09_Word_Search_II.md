# Word Search II

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where adjacent cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

## Approach
The algorithm uses a Trie data structure to store the dictionary words, and then uses backtracking to explore all possible paths on the board that match a word in the Trie. The backtracking function checks for each cell if it matches the current character in the word, and if so, recursively explores the neighboring cells.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N * M * 4^L), where N and M are the dimensions of the board, and L is the maximum length of a word
- Space: O(N * M + D), where D is the total number of characters in the dictionary

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TrieNode {
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    string word;
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        for (string word : words) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            for (char c : word) {
                if (node->children.find(c) == node->children.end()) {
                    node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node->children[c];
            }
            node->word = word;
        }

        vector<string> result;
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(board.size(), vector<bool>(board[0].size(), false));
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                backtrack(board, i, j, root, result, visited);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    void backtrack(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, TrieNode* node, vector<string>& result, vector<vector<bool>>& visited) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || visited[i][j] || node->children.find(board[i][j]) == node->children.end()) {
            return;
        }

        node = node->children[board[i][j]];
        if (!node->word.empty()) {
            result.push_back(node->word);
            node->word.clear();
        }

        visited[i][j] = true;
        backtrack(board, i - 1, j, node, result, visited);
        backtrack(board, i + 1, j, node, result, visited);
        backtrack(board, i, j - 1, node, result, visited);
        backtrack(board, i, j + 1, node, result, visited);
        visited[i][j] = false;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<char>> board = {
        {'o', 'a', 'a', 'n'},
        {'e', 't', 'a', 'e'},
        {'i', 'h', 'k', 'r'},
        {'i', 'f', 'l', 'v'}
    };
    vector<string> words = {"oath", "pea", "eat", "rain"};
    vector<string> result = solution.findWords(board, words);
    for (string word : result) {
        cout << word << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: board = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["oath","eat"]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a Trie data structure to efficiently store and look up words in the dictionary.
- Implement a backtracking function to explore all possible paths on the board that match a word in the Trie.
- Use a visited matrix to keep track of visited cells and avoid revisiting them.
