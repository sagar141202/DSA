# K Closest Points to Origin

## Problem Statement
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on a 2D plane, find the k closest points to the origin (0, 0). The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Return the k closest points. You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (no two different points have the same distance to the origin).

## Approach
We can use a priority queue to store the points along with their distances from the origin. The priority queue will be ordered based on the distance, so the points with the smallest distance will be at the top. We can then pop the top k points from the queue to get the k closest points.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n log k)
- Space: O(k)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

struct compare {
    bool operator()(const Point& a, const Point& b) {
        int distA = a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y;
        int distB = b.x * b.x + b.y * b.y;
        return distA > distB;
    }
};

vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
    priority_queue<Point, vector<Point>, compare> pq;
    for (auto& point : points) {
        Point p;
        p.x = point[0];
        p.y = point[1];
        if (pq.size() < k) {
            pq.push(p);
        } else if (p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y < pq.top().x * pq.top().x + pq.top().y * pq.top().y) {
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(p);
        }
    }
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Point p = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        result.push_back({p.x, p.y});
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: points = [[1, 3], [-2, 2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2, 2]]
Input: points = [[3, 3], [5, -1], [-2, 4]], k = 2
Output: [[3, 3], [-2, 4]]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a priority queue to efficiently find the k smallest elements.
- The distance between two points can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
- The priority queue can be used to keep track of the k closest points seen so far.
