# Rotate Array

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps. The rotation should be performed in-place, meaning that the original array should be modified directly. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, the rotated array should be `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The input array will contain between 1 and 10^5 elements, and `k` will be between 0 and 10^5.

## Approach
The approach involves using a temporary array to store the rotated elements, then copying them back to the original array. Alternatively, we can use a more efficient approach involving three reversals: reversing the entire array, reversing the first `k` elements, and reversing the rest of the array.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1) for the in-place approach, O(n) for the temporary array approach

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Calculate the effective number of steps to rotate
        k = k % nums.size();
        
        // Reverse the entire array
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Reverse the first k elements
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
        
        // Reverse the rest of the array
        reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.end());
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int k = 3;
    solution.rotate(nums, k);
    for (int num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 7
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

## Key Takeaways
- The rotation can be performed in-place using three reversals.
- The effective number of steps to rotate is `k % n`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1) for the in-place approach.
