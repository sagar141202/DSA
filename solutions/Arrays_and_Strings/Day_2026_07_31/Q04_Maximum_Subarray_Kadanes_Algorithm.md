# Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. The array may contain both positive and negative integers. For example, given the array `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`, the maximum subarray sum is `6` which is the sum of the subarray `[4,-1,2,1]`.

## Approach
Kadane's algorithm scans the entire array and at each position finds the maximum sum of the subarray ending at that position. It uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum sum found so far. The algorithm iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum of the current subarray and updates the maximum sum whenever a larger sum is found.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize the maximum sum and the current sum to the first element of the array
        int maxSum = nums[0];
        int currentSum = nums[0];
        
        // Iterate through the array starting from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Update the current sum to be the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous current sum
            currentSum = max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);
            
            // Update the maximum sum if the current sum is greater
            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        // Return the maximum sum found
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

## Key Takeaways
- Kadane's algorithm is an efficient solution for finding the maximum subarray sum in an array.
- The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it suitable for large inputs.
- The algorithm can be easily modified to find the maximum subarray sum in a 2D array or to find the minimum subarray sum.
