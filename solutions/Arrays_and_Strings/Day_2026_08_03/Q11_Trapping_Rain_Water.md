# Trapping Rain Water

## Problem Statement
Given an array of non-negative integers representing the height of bars in a histogram, find the amount of water that can be trapped between the bars. The height of each bar is represented by the value at each index in the array. The water can be trapped between two bars if there is a bar of greater height on both the left and right sides. The task is to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped.

## Approach
The solution involves using two pointers, one starting from the left and one from the right, to track the maximum height of the bars on both sides. The algorithm iterates through the array, updating the maximum height on both sides and calculating the trapped water at each step.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxLeft = 0, maxRight = 0;
        int result = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= maxLeft) {
                    maxLeft = height[left];
                } else {
                    result += maxLeft - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= maxRight) {
                    maxRight = height[right];
                } else {
                    result += maxRight - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use two pointers to track the maximum height on both sides.
- Update the maximum height on both sides and calculate the trapped water at each step.
- The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is constant.
