# Insert Interval

## Problem Statement
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary). You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times. The intervals are represented as vectors of two integers, where the first integer represents the start time and the second integer represents the end time. The new interval will be given as a vector of two integers. The function should return the updated intervals after insertion.

## Approach
We will iterate through the given intervals and compare their start and end times with the new interval. If the new interval overlaps with the current interval, we will merge them. If not, we will add the new interval to the result list at the correct position. We will maintain a list to store the merged intervals.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> insertInterval(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int i = 0;
    // add all intervals that come before the new interval
    while (i < intervals.size() && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
        result.push_back(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }
    // merge all overlapping intervals
    while (i < intervals.size() && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
        newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
        newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
        i++;
    }
    // add the merged interval
    result.push_back(newInterval);
    // add all remaining intervals
    while (i < intervals.size()) {
        result.push_back(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
```

## Key Takeaways
- We iterate through the intervals only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
- We use a result list to store the merged intervals, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
- The key to solving this problem is to correctly handle the merging of overlapping intervals.
