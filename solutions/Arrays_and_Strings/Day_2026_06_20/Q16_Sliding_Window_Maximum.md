# Sliding Window Maximum

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum value in each `k`-sized subarray. The subarray should be fully contained within the array, and the window should move one element to the right between each subarray. For example, given `nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[3,3,5,5,6,7]`.

## Approach
The algorithm uses a deque to store the indices of the elements in the current window. It maintains the deque such that the front always contains the index of the maximum element in the window. The deque is updated as the window moves to the right.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(k)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Initialize the result vector and the deque
    vector<int> result;
    deque<int> dq;

    // Iterate over the array
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        // Remove elements from the back of the deque that are out of the window
        while (!dq.empty() && dq.front() < i - k + 1) {
            dq.pop_front();
        }

        // Remove elements from the front of the deque that are smaller than the current element
        while (!dq.empty() && nums[dq.back()] < nums[i]) {
            dq.pop_back();
        }

        // Add the current element to the deque
        dq.push_back(i);

        // Add the maximum element in the window to the result vector
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            result.push_back(nums[dq.front()]);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
Input: nums = [1,-1], k = 1
Output: [1,-1]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a deque to store the indices of the elements in the current window.
- Maintain the deque such that the front always contains the index of the maximum element in the window.
- Update the deque as the window moves to the right.
