# Insert Interval

## Problem Statement
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary). You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times. The intervals are represented as vectors of two integers, for example, [1,3] represents the interval [1,3]. If the new interval does not overlap with any of the existing intervals, it should be added as a new interval. If it does overlap, the overlapping intervals should be merged into a single interval.

## Approach
The approach is to iterate over the existing intervals, add non-overlapping intervals to the result, and merge overlapping intervals with the new interval. We will use a simple iterative method to check for overlaps and merge the intervals.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int i = 0;
    // add all intervals that come before the new interval
    while (i < intervals.size() && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
        result.push_back(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }
    // merge all overlapping intervals
    while (i < intervals.size() && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
        newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
        newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
        i++;
    }
    // add the merged interval
    result.push_back(newInterval);
    // add all remaining intervals
    while (i < intervals.size()) {
        result.push_back(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
```

## Key Takeaways
- The key to solving this problem is to iterate over the existing intervals and merge overlapping intervals with the new interval.
- We use a simple iterative method to check for overlaps and merge the intervals.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of existing intervals.
