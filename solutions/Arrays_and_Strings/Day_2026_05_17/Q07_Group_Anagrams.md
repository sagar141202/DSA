# Group Anagrams

## Problem Statement
Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. The input array will contain at most 10^4 strings, and each string will contain at most 10^4 characters. The strings will only contain lowercase letters. For example, given the input `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`, the output should be `[["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]`.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is to use a hashmap where the sorted version of each string is used as the key, and the value is a list of strings that are anagrams of each other. We iterate over each string in the input array, sort its characters, and use the sorted string as the key in the hashmap. If the key already exists, we append the current string to the list of values. If the key does not exist, we create a new entry in the hashmap with the sorted string as the key and a list containing the current string as the value.

## Complexity
- Time: O(NMlogM)
- Space: O(NM)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> anagrams;
        for (const string& str : strs) {
            string sortedStr = str;
            sort(sortedStr.begin(), sortedStr.end());
            anagrams[sortedStr].push_back(str);
        }
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        for (const auto& pair : anagrams) {
            result.push_back(pair.second);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]
Input: [""]
Output: [[""]]
Input: ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a hashmap to group anagrams together based on their sorted characters.
- The time complexity is O(NMlogM) due to the sorting of each string, where N is the number of strings and M is the maximum length of a string.
- The space complexity is O(NM) for storing the anagrams in the hashmap.
