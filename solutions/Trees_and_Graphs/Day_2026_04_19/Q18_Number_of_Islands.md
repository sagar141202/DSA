# Number of Islands

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid consisting of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is a group of connected '1's. The task is to write a function that takes a 2D grid as input and returns the number of islands. The grid can contain any number of islands, and each island can be of any size. The function should be efficient and scalable.

## Approach
The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid and count the number of islands. It iterates over each cell in the grid, and when it encounters a '1', it performs a DFS to mark all connected '1's as visited. The number of times DFS is called represents the number of islands.

## Complexity
- Time: O(M*N)
- Space: O(M*N)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty() || grid[0].empty()) return 0;
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != '1') return;
        
        grid[i][j] = '0'; // mark as visited
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j); // up
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j); // down
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1); // left
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1); // right
    }
};

```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Input: [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use DFS to traverse the grid and count the number of islands.
- Mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
- The algorithm has a time complexity of O(M*N), where M and N are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.
