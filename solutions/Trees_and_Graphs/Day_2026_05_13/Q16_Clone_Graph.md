# Clone Graph

## Problem Statement
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors. The given node will always be in the graph and will never be null. The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [1, 100]. The values of the nodes are in the range [1, 100]. Each node's value is unique.

## Approach
The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and clone each node. It utilizes an unordered map to store the cloned nodes and avoid duplicate cloning. The DFS function recursively clones the neighbors of each node.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N + M)
- Space: O(N)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if (!node) return nullptr;
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> cloned;
        return dfs(node, cloned);
    }
    
    Node* dfs(Node* node, unordered_map<Node*, Node*>& cloned) {
        if (cloned.find(node) != cloned.end()) return cloned[node];
        Node* clone = new Node(node->val);
        cloned[node] = clone;
        for (Node* neighbor : node->neighbors) {
            clone->neighbors.push_back(dfs(neighbor, cloned));
        }
        return clone;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[2,1],[1,2]]
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use an unordered map to store the cloned nodes and avoid duplicate cloning.
- Utilize a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and clone each node.
- Recursively clone the neighbors of each node to ensure a deep copy of the graph.
