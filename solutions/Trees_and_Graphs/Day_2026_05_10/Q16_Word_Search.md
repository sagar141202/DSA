# Word Search

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once. For example, given a board like this:
```
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
```
and a word "ABCCED", the function returns true, because "ABCCED" can be formed by moving right and down from the starting cell 'A'.

## Approach
The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths in the grid. It checks for the existence of the word by comparing characters in the word with the characters in the grid. If a match is found, it continues the search with the next character in the word.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N*M*4^L)
- Space: O(N*M + L)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        int rows = board.size();
        int cols = board[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == word[0]) {
                    if (dfs(board, word, i, j, 0)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word, int i, int j, int k) {
        if (k == word.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || word[k] != board[i][j]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '#';
        
        bool found = dfs(board, word, i + 1, j, k + 1) ||
                      dfs(board, word, i - 1, j, k + 1) ||
                      dfs(board, word, i, j + 1, k + 1) ||
                      dfs(board, word, i, j - 1, k + 1);
        
        board[i][j] = temp;
        
        return found;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Input: 
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "SEE"
Output: true

Input: 
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use a DFS approach to explore all possible paths in the grid.
- Mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them and to ensure that the same letter cell is not used more than once.
- Backtrack and restore the original cell value after exploring all possible paths from a cell.
