# Word Search

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once. For example, given the following board:
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
and the word "ABCCED", the function should return true because the word can be found in the grid.
The board is a 2D array of characters, and the word is a string. The function should return a boolean indicating whether the word exists in the grid.

## Approach
The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid and find the word. It checks all possible directions (up, down, left, right) from each cell. If the current character in the word matches the character in the cell, it continues the search in the adjacent cells.

## Complexity
- Time: O(N*M*4^L)
- Space: O(N*M + L)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        int rows = board.size();
        int cols = board[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == word[0]) {
                    if (dfs(board, word, i, j, 0)) return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, string& word, int i, int j, int k) {
        if (k == word.size()) return true;
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || word[k] != board[i][j]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '#';
        
        bool found = dfs(board, word, i + 1, j, k + 1) ||
                      dfs(board, word, i - 1, j, k + 1) ||
                      dfs(board, word, i, j + 1, k + 1) ||
                      dfs(board, word, i, j - 1, k + 1);
        
        board[i][j] = temp;
        
        return found;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Input: 
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "SEE"
Output: true

Input: 
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

## Key Takeaways
- The DFS approach is suitable for this problem as it allows us to explore all possible paths in the grid.
- We use a temporary character to mark visited cells and avoid revisiting them.
- The time complexity is exponential due to the recursive nature of the DFS, but it is necessary to explore all possible paths.
