# Number of Islands

## Problem Statement
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. The input grid is guaranteed to have at least one island. Example: Input: [
["1","1","1","1","0"],
["1","1","0","1","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

## Approach
The problem can be solved using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and count the number of islands. The algorithm will iterate over each cell in the grid, and when it encounters a land cell, it will perform a DFS to mark all adjacent land cells as visited. The number of times the DFS is performed represents the number of islands.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m * n)
- Space: O(m * n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty()) return 0;
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != '1') {
            return;
        }
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
["1","1","1","1","0"],
["1","1","0","1","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

## Key Takeaways
- The DFS algorithm is used to traverse the grid and count the number of islands.
- The time complexity is O(m * n) because in the worst case, we need to visit every cell in the grid.
- The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the recursive call stack in the worst case.
