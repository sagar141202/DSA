# Lowest Common Ancestor of BST

## Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST) and two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes. The LCA is the node farthest from the root that is an ancestor of both nodes. The BST is defined such that for any node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node. The input will consist of the root of the BST and the values of the two nodes.

## Approach
The algorithm works by traversing the BST from the root, checking if the current node's value is greater than or less than both node values. If it's greater, we move to the left subtree; if it's less, we move to the right subtree. If the current node's value is between the two node values, it's the LCA.

## Complexity
- Time: O(h)
- Space: O(h)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // if the current node is NULL, return NULL
        if (!root) return NULL;
        
        // if the current node's value is greater than both p and q, move to the left subtree
        if (root->val > p->val && root->val > q->val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        }
        
        // if the current node's value is less than both p and q, move to the right subtree
        if (root->val < p->val && root->val < q->val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        }
        
        // if the current node's value is between p and q, it's the LCA
        return root;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
     6
   /   \
  2     8
 / \   / \
0   4 7   9
    / \
   3   5
p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6

Input: 
     6
   /   \
  2     8
 / \   / \
0   4 7   9
    / \
   3   5
p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
```

## Key Takeaways
- The LCA of two nodes in a BST can be found by traversing the tree from the root.
- If the current node's value is greater than or less than both node values, we move to the left or right subtree, respectively.
- The algorithm has a time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree, which is O(log n) for a balanced BST.
