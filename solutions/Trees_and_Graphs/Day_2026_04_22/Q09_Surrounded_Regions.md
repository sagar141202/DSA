# Surrounded Regions

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured by flipping all 'O's in that region to 'X'. The region is surrounded if all 'O' connected to the edge of the board are 'X'. For example, consider the following board:
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running the function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
The input is a 2D vector of characters, and the output should be the modified 2D vector.

## Approach
The algorithm involves using depth-first search (DFS) to mark all 'O' regions connected to the edge of the board, then flipping all unmarked 'O' to 'X' and all marked 'O' back to 'O'. This approach ensures that only surrounded 'O' regions are flipped.

## Complexity
- Time: O(M*N)
- Space: O(M*N)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
    if (board.empty() || board[0].empty()) return;

    int m = board.size();
    int n = board[0].size();

    // mark all 'O' regions connected to the edge
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (board[i][0] == 'O') dfs(board, i, 0);
        if (board[i][n-1] == 'O') dfs(board, i, n-1);
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (board[0][j] == 'O') dfs(board, 0, j);
        if (board[m-1][j] == 'O') dfs(board, m-1, j);
    }

    // flip all unmarked 'O' to 'X' and all marked 'O' back to 'O'
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X';
            else if (board[i][j] == '#') board[i][j] = 'O';
        }
    }
}

void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j) {
    if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || board[i][j] != 'O') return;
    board[i][j] = '#';
    dfs(board, i-1, j);
    dfs(board, i+1, j);
    dfs(board, i, j-1);
    dfs(board, i, j+1);
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<char>> board = {
        {'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'},
        {'X', 'O', 'O', 'X'},
        {'X', 'X', 'O', 'X'},
        {'X', 'O', 'X', 'X'}
    };

    solve(board);

    for (const auto& row : board) {
        for (char c : row) {
            cout << c << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X

Output: 
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use DFS to mark all 'O' regions connected to the edge of the board.
- Flip all unmarked 'O' to 'X' and all marked 'O' back to 'O' in a separate pass.
- The time complexity is O(M*N) because we visit each cell at most twice.
