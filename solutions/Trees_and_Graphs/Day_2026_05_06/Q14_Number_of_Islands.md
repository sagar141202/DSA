# Number of Islands

## Problem Statement
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. The input grid will be a 2D array of size m x n, where each cell can have a value of '0' or '1'. The function should return the total number of islands in the grid. For example, given the grid:
```
[
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
The output should be 1.

## Approach
The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid and count the number of islands. It iterates through each cell in the grid, and if the cell is a land ('1'), it performs a DFS to mark all adjacent lands as visited. The number of times a DFS is performed is equal to the number of islands.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(std::vector<std::vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty()) return 0;
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    void dfs(std::vector<std::vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != '1') return;
        
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Input: [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use DFS to traverse the grid and count the number of islands.
- Mark visited lands as '0' to avoid revisiting them.
- The number of times a DFS is performed is equal to the number of islands.
