# Number of Islands

## Problem Statement
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. The input grid will be a 2D array of size m x n, where m and n are in the range [1, 200]. The elements of the grid will be either '0' or '1'. For example, given the following grid:
```
[
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
The output should be 1, because there is only one island in the grid.

## Approach
The approach is to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and count the number of islands. We will start from each unvisited land cell and mark all its adjacent land cells as visited. We will repeat this process until all cells have been visited. The number of times we start a new DFS traversal will be the number of islands.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty() || grid[0].empty()) return 0;
        
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != '1') return;
        
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<char>> grid = {
        {'1', '1', '1', '1', '0'},
        {'1', '1', '0', '1', '0'},
        {'1', '1', '0', '0', '0'},
        {'0', '0', '0', '0', '0'}
    };
    
    cout << solution.numIslands(grid) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Input: [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Key Takeaways
- The DFS algorithm is used to traverse the grid and count the number of islands.
- The grid is modified in-place to mark visited cells.
- The time complexity is O(m*n) because in the worst case, we need to visit every cell in the grid.
- The space complexity is O(m*n) because in the worst case, the recursive call stack can go up to m*n.
