# Number of Islands

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid consisting of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is a group of connected '1's. The task is to write a function that takes a 2D grid as input and returns the number of islands. The grid can contain any number of islands, and the islands can be of any size. For example, given the grid:
```
[
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
The output should be 1, because there is only one island in the grid.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid and count the number of islands. We will iterate over each cell in the grid, and if the cell is a '1', we will perform a DFS from that cell to mark all connected '1's as visited.

## Complexity
- Time: O(M*N), where M is the number of rows in the grid and N is the number of columns.
- Space: O(M*N), where M is the number of rows in the grid and N is the number of columns.

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty()) return 0;
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != '1') {
            return;
        }
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Input: [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Key Takeaways
- We use DFS to traverse the grid and count the number of islands.
- We mark all connected '1's as visited by setting them to '0' to avoid counting them multiple times.
- We use a recursive function to perform the DFS traversal.
