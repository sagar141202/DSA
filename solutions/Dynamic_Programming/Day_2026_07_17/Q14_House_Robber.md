# House Robber

## Problem Statement
You are a professional thief planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by maintaining an array where each element represents the maximum amount that can be robbed up to that house. We can rob the current house if we didn't rob the previous one, or we can choose not to rob the current house.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) return 0;
        if (nums.size() == 1) return nums[0];
        
        vector<int> dp(nums.size());
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i]);
        }
        
        return dp[nums.size() - 1];
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total money you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

## Key Takeaways
- Dynamic programming is used to store the maximum amount that can be robbed up to each house.
- We have two options for each house: rob it or not rob it. If we rob it, we cannot rob the previous house. If we don't rob it, we can rob the previous house.
- The final result is the maximum amount that can be robbed up to the last house.
