# House Robber II

## Problem Statement
You are a professional thief planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. The houses are arranged in a circle, meaning the first house is adjacent to the last house.

## Approach
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming to find the maximum amount that can be robbed in two cases: one where the first house is robbed and the last house is not, and one where the first house is not robbed. We will use a bottom-up approach to fill up a table with the maximum amount that can be robbed up to each house.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return nums[0];
        if (n == 2) return max(nums[0], nums[1]);

        // Case 1: Rob the first house, don't rob the last house
        vector<int> dp1(n);
        dp1[0] = nums[0];
        dp1[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        for (int i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            dp1[i] = max(dp1[i - 1], dp1[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }

        // Case 2: Don't rob the first house
        vector<int> dp2(n);
        dp2[0] = 0;
        dp2[1] = nums[1];
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp2[i] = max(dp2[i - 1], dp2[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }

        return max(dp1[n - 2], dp2[n - 1]);
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
```

## Key Takeaways
- The problem can be divided into two cases: one where the first house is robbed and one where it is not.
- Dynamic programming can be used to solve the problem efficiently by avoiding redundant calculations.
- The base cases for the dynamic programming approach are when there is only one or two houses.
