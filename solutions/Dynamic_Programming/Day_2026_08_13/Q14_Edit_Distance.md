# Edit Distance

## Problem Statement
The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to change one string into the other. Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, find the edit distance between them. The strings only contain lowercase letters, and the length of each string is at most 500. For example, the edit distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3 (replace 'k' with 's', replace 'e' with 'i', append 'g').

## Approach
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`. The edit distance is calculated by considering the minimum cost of insertion, deletion, and substitution.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n*m)
- Space: O(n*m)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n = word1.size(), m = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));
        
        // Initialize the base cases
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        
        // Fill in the rest of the table
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][m];
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: word1 = "kitten", word2 = "sitting"
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
```

## Key Takeaways
- The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems and solved using dynamic programming.
- The time complexity is O(n*m) where n and m are the lengths of the input strings.
- The space complexity is O(n*m) for storing the 2D array `dp`.
