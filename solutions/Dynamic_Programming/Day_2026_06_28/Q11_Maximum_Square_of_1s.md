# Maximum Square of 1s

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0s and 1s, find the largest square containing only 1s and return its area. The matrix will have dimensions mxn where m and n are between 1 and 200. Each cell can have a value of either 0 or 1. For example, given the following matrix:
```
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
```
The largest square of 1s has an area of 4.

## Approach
The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table where each cell represents the size of the largest square ending at that cell. The size of the largest square is then the maximum value in this table. This approach ensures that we consider all possible squares in the matrix.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int maxSide = 0;
        
        // Initialize the first row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0] - '0';
            maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][0]);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j] - '0';
            maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[0][j]);
        }
        
        // Fill up the rest of the table
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    dp[i][j] = min(min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                    maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxSide * maxSide;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 4
```

## Key Takeaways
- The dynamic programming approach allows us to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
- We use a 2D table `dp` to store the size of the largest square ending at each cell.
- The final result is the square of the maximum value in the `dp` table.
