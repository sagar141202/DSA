# Palindromic Substrings

## Problem Statement
Given a string, count the total number of palindromic substrings. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same backward as forward. For example, in the string "abc", the palindromic substrings are "a", "b", and "c". In the string "aaa", the palindromic substrings are "a", "aa", "aaa". The input string will only contain lowercase English letters. The length of the input string will be between 1 and 1000.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming to store whether each substring is palindromic or not. We will iterate over the string and for each character, we will check all possible substrings. If a substring is palindromic, we will store it in our dp table.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n^2)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
        int count = 0;
        
        // all substrings with one character are palindromes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = true;
            count++;
        }
        
        // check for substrings of length 2
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (s[i] == s[i + 1]) {
                dp[i][i + 1] = true;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // check for lengths greater than 2
        for (int length = 3; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - length + 1; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j] && dp[i + 1][j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use dynamic programming to store the palindromic status of each substring.
- Start with substrings of length 1 and 2, and then expand to longer lengths.
- For a substring to be palindromic, the first and last characters must be the same, and the substring in between must also be palindromic.
