# House Robber II

## Problem Statement
You are a professional thief planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. The street is a circle, meaning the first house is adjacent to the last house.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by breaking it down into two cases: one where the first house is robbed and one where the first house is not robbed. We then find the maximum amount that can be robbed in each case.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) return nums[0];
        if (nums.size() == 2) return max(nums[0], nums[1]);

        // case 1: rob the first house
        vector<int> dp1(nums.size());
        dp1[0] = nums[0];
        dp1[1] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            dp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1], dp1[i-2] + nums[i]);
        }

        // case 2: do not rob the first house
        vector<int> dp2(nums.size());
        dp2[0] = 0;
        dp2[1] = nums[1];
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            dp2[i] = max(dp2[i-1], dp2[i-2] + nums[i]);
        }

        return max(dp1[nums.size() - 2], dp2[nums.size() - 1]);
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
```

## Key Takeaways
- Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems to apply dynamic programming.
- Consider all possible cases to ensure the solution is correct.
- Use arrays or vectors to store the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations.
