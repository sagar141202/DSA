# Maximum Square of 1s

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0s and 1s, find the largest square containing all 1s and return its area. The matrix can be of size up to 200x200, and each cell can have a value of either 0 or 1. For example, given the following matrix:
```
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
```
The largest square of 1s has an area of 4.

## Approach
We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem, where each cell in the DP table represents the size of the largest square ending at that cell. The value of each cell will be determined based on the values of the cells above, to the left, and to the top-left of it.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int maxSide = 0;
        
        // Initialize the first row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0] - '0';
            maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][0]);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j] - '0';
            maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[0][j]);
        }
        
        // Fill the rest of the table
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])) + 1;
                    maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxSide * maxSide;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 4

Input: 
[
  ["0"]
]
Output: 0

Input: 
[
  ["1"]
]
Output: 1
```

## Key Takeaways
- The dynamic programming table `dp` is used to store the size of the largest square ending at each cell.
- The value of each cell in `dp` is determined based on the values of the cells above, to the left, and to the top-left of it.
- The maximum side length of the square is updated at each step, and the final result is the square of this maximum side length.
