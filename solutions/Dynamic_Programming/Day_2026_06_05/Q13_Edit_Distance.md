# Edit Distance

## Problem Statement
The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to change one string into the other. Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, find the edit distance between them. The edit distance is also known as the Levenshtein distance. For example, the edit distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, as we can change "kitten" to "sitting" by substituting "s" for "k", substituting "i" for "e", and appending "g".

## Approach
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating a 2D table to store the edit distances between substrings of `word1` and `word2`. We fill the table in a bottom-up manner, considering all possible operations at each step. The edit distance between the two strings is stored in the bottom-right corner of the table.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.size();
        int n = word2.size();
        // Create a 2D table to store the edit distances
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        // Initialize the base cases
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        
        // Fill the table in a bottom-up manner
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The edit distance is stored in the bottom-right corner of the table
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: word1 = "kitten", word2 = "sitting"
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
```

## Key Takeaways
- The edit distance problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating a 2D table to store the edit distances between substrings.
- The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, considering all possible operations at each step.
- The edit distance between the two strings is stored in the bottom-right corner of the table.
