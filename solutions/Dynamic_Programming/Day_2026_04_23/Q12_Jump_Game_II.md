# Jump Game II

## Problem Statement
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps. If it is impossible to reach the last index, return -1. The array has at least one element, and the length of the array is less than or equal to 1000.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming and greedy approach. We can maintain an array to store the minimum number of jumps required to reach each position. We iterate through the array and update the minimum number of jumps required to reach each position. The idea is to always try to extend the current jump as far as possible.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        int maxReach = nums[0];
        int step = nums[0];
        int jumps = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == n - 1) return jumps;
            
            maxReach = max(maxReach, i + nums[i]);
            step--;
            
            if (step == 0) {
                jumps++;
                if (i >= maxReach) return -1;
                step = maxReach - i;
            }
        }
        
        return jumps;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Input: [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use dynamic programming and greedy approach to solve the problem.
- Always try to extend the current jump as far as possible.
- Keep track of the maximum reachable position and the number of steps remaining in the current jump.
