# Maximum Square of 1s

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0s and 1s, find the largest square containing all 1s and return its area. The matrix can have a size of up to 200x200, and the input will always be a valid 2D matrix.

## Approach
We use dynamic programming to build a table where each cell represents the size of the largest square ending at that cell. The value of each cell is determined by the minimum size of the squares above, to the left, and to the top-left, plus one.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int maxSide = 0;
        
        // Initialize the first row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0] - '0';
            maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][0]);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j] - '0';
            maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[0][j]);
        }
        
        // Fill the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]}) + 1;
                    maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxSide * maxSide;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 4
```

## Key Takeaways
- Use dynamic programming to solve problems that have overlapping subproblems.
- Initialize the base cases properly to ensure the dp table is filled correctly.
- Keep track of the maximum value seen so far to return the final result.
