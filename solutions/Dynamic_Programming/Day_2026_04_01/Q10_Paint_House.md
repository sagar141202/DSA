# Paint House

## Problem Statement
There are a row of houses, each house can be painted with three colors: red, blue and green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is given. You need to find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

## Approach
We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to maintain three arrays, one for each color, where the i-th element of the array represents the minimum cost to paint the first i houses with the last house being of that color. We will fill up these arrays iteratively, considering the minimum cost of painting the previous house with a different color.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        if (costs.empty()) return 0;
        int n = costs.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(3, 0));
        dp[0][0] = costs[0][0];
        dp[0][1] = costs[0][1];
        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]);
            dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]);
            dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]);
        }
        return min({dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2]});
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
```

## Key Takeaways
- The key to solving this problem is to use dynamic programming to maintain the minimum cost of painting each house with each color.
- The time complexity is O(n) because we only need to iterate through the houses once.
- The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the minimum cost of painting each house with each color.
