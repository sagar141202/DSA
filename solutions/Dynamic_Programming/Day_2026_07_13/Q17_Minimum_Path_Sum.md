# Minimum Path Sum

## Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time. The input grid will have `m` rows and `n` columns, where each cell contains a non-negative integer. For example, given the following grid: 
```
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
```
The minimum path sum from top left to bottom right is `1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7`.

## Approach
We use dynamic programming to solve this problem by maintaining a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`. We fill up the `dp` array row by row, using the previously computed values to calculate the minimum path sum for each cell.

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        // Initialize the first cell
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            grid[0][i] += grid[0][i-1];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0];
        }
        
        // Fill up the rest of the grid
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        
        // The minimum path sum is stored in the bottom right cell
        return grid[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
```

## Key Takeaways
- We use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.
- The time complexity is O(m*n) because we need to fill up the entire grid.
- The space complexity is O(1) if we modify the input grid, or O(m*n) if we create a separate dp array.
