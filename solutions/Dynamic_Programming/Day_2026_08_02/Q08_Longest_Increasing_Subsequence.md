# Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, given `nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`, the longest increasing subsequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`, so the output should be `4`. The array may contain duplicates, and the length of the array is between `1` and `1000`.

## Approach
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming by maintaining an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i`. We iterate through the array and for each element, we compare it with all previous elements and update `dp[i]` if a longer increasing subsequence is found.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);
        int max_length = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            max_length = max(max_length, dp[i]);
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 4
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 4
Input: nums = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
Output: 1
```

## Key Takeaways
- The dynamic programming approach allows us to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and store the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computation.
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, where n is the length of the input array.
- The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store the `dp` array of length n.
