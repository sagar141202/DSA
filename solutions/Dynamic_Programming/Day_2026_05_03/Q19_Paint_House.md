# Paint House

## Problem Statement
There are a row of houses, each house can be painted with three colors: red, blue and green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is given. You need to find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

## Approach
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by maintaining the minimum cost for each house and each color. We start from the first house and for each house, we calculate the minimum cost for each color by considering the minimum cost of the previous house with a different color. 

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        if (costs.empty()) return 0;
        int n = costs.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(3, 0));
        
        // Initialize the base case
        dp[0][0] = costs[0][0];
        dp[0][1] = costs[0][1];
        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];
        
        // Fill up the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]);
            dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]);
            dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]);
        }
        
        // The minimum cost is the minimum of the last row
        return min({dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2]});
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
```

## Key Takeaways
- We use dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently.
- We maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i-th` house is painted with color `j`.
- The base case is when there is only one house, in which case the minimum cost is the cost of painting the house with each color.
