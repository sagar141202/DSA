# Palindromic Substrings

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, count the total number of palindromic substrings in it. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same backward as forward. For example, in the string "abc", the palindromic substrings are "a", "b", and "c". In the string "aaa", the palindromic substrings are "a", "aa", "aaa". The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 1000 characters.

## Approach
The approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents whether the corresponding substring is palindromic or not. We can then count the number of palindromic substrings by iterating over this table.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n^2)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
        int count = 0;
        
        // all substrings with one character are palindromes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = true;
            count++;
        }
        
        // check for substrings of length 2
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (s[i] == s[i + 1]) {
                dp[i][i + 1] = true;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // check for lengths greater than 2
        for (int length = 3; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - length + 1; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j] && dp[i + 1][j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
```

## Key Takeaways
- We use a dynamic programming approach to build a table of palindromic substrings.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we are iterating over the string with two nested loops.
- The space complexity is also O(n^2) because we need to store the table of palindromic substrings.
