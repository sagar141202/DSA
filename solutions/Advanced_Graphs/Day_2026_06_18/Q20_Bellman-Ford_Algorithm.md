# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

## Problem Statement
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It can handle negative weight edges and can detect negative weight cycles. The algorithm takes as input a graph represented as an adjacency list or matrix, a source vertex, and the number of vertices in the graph. The output is the shortest distance from the source vertex to all other vertices. If a negative weight cycle is detected, the algorithm reports that no shortest path exists.

## Approach
The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by relaxing all edges V-1 times, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. It then checks for negative weight cycles by trying to relax all edges one more time. If any edge can still be relaxed, then a negative weight cycle exists.

## Complexity
- Time: O(VE)
- Space: O(V)

## C++ Solution
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Graph {
public:
    int V;
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;

    Graph(int vertices) {
        V = vertices;
        adj.resize(vertices);
    }

    void addEdge(int u, int v, int w) {
        adj[u].push_back({v, w});
    }

    void bellmanFord(int src) {
        vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
        dist[src] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < V - 1; i++) {
            for (int u = 0; u < V; u++) {
                for (auto edge : adj[u]) {
                    int v = edge.first;
                    int w = edge.second;
                    if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        for (int u = 0; u < V; u++) {
            for (auto edge : adj[u]) {
                int v = edge.first;
                int w = edge.second;
                if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    cout << "Negative weight cycle detected" << endl;
                    return;
                }
            }
        }

        cout << "Vertex\tDistance from Source" << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            cout << i << "\t" << dist[i] << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Graph g(5);
    g.addEdge(0, 1, -1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2, 4);
    g.addEdge(1, 2, 3);
    g.addEdge(1, 3, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 4, 2);
    g.addEdge(3, 2, 5);
    g.addEdge(3, 1, 1);
    g.addEdge(4, 3, -3);

    g.bellmanFord(0);

    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases
```
Input: 
Graph with 5 vertices and edges: (0, 1, -1), (0, 2, 4), (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (1, 4, 2), (3, 2, 5), (3, 1, 1), (4, 3, -3)
Source vertex: 0
Output: 
Vertex Distance from Source
0      0
1      -1
2      2
3      -2
4      1
```

## Key Takeaways

- It has a time complexity of O(VE), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- It has a space complexity of O(V), where V is the number of vertices.
